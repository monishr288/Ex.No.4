### REGISTER NUMBER : 212223220061 
### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Scenario:
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.
Target Audience:
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.


Main Objectives:

•	Improve production efficiency by 30%.
•	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.
•	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.
•	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.
 
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Idea Generation Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?” Generated Ideas:
•	Sensors for real-time monitoring of equipment performance.
•	Predictive maintenance alerts to anticipate equipment failures.
•	Energy usage optimization by automating the switching of machines on/off based on demand.
•	Cloud-based dashboards for remote monitoring and control of machinery.

Persona and Context Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?” Generated Context:
•	The user interface should be intuitive and provide real-time data on machine performance, energy usage, and alerts.
•	The system should convey reliability and ease of use, with minimal training required for operators.
# OUTPUT 

## Objective
Design and evaluate an AI-powered chatbot for retail customer support by using multiple prompting techniques to guide experiment design, data collection, performance evaluation, and report generation.

## 1. Comparative Analysis Prompt
Purpose: Evaluate different chatbot versions or configurations by comparing their performance on key metrics.

## Prompt Example:
"Compare the performance of Chatbot A (rule-based responses) and Chatbot B (LLM-powered responses) in handling customer queries related to order tracking. Evaluate them based on response time, accuracy, customer satisfaction, and escalation rate."

## Implementation:

Run identical customer queries (e.g., “Where is my order?”, “How can I cancel?”) through both chatbot versions.

Collect and analyze metrics like resolution time, correctness, and user ratings.

Visualize results using graphs or tables in the report.

## 2. Scenario Testing Prompt
Purpose: Test the chatbot in realistic or edge-case situations to assess its reliability and robustness.

## Prompt Example:
"You are a customer who received the wrong item. Simulate a full conversation with the chatbot to resolve the issue. Log the steps taken, clarity of guidance, and final resolution."

## Variations:

Customer wants a refund for a defective product.

Customer has a billing dispute.

Customer needs help with a loyalty program.

Implementation:

Use role-play or scripted input-output pairs to simulate real interactions.

Document success/failure cases and improvement opportunities.

## 3. Prompt Size Limitations
Purpose: Explore how the chatbot performs under constraints in input size, which can affect its ability to understand context or provide comprehensive responses.

## Prompt Example:
Short Prompt:
“Help with refund.”
Long Prompt:
“Hi, I bought a pair of shoes from your online store last week, but they were a size too small. I tried initiating a return via the app, but it keeps giving an error. Can you help me with the refund process?”

## Implementation:

Analyze chatbot behavior with both short and long user inputs.

Evaluate accuracy, clarity, and helpfulness in both scenarios.

Use this data to fine-tune response generation models or implement input-length pre-processing logic.
