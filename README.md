### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Scenario:
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.
Target Audience:
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.


Main Objectives:

•	Improve production efficiency by 30%.
•	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.
•	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.
•	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.
 
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Idea Generation Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?” Generated Ideas:
•	Sensors for real-time monitoring of equipment performance.
•	Predictive maintenance alerts to anticipate equipment failures.
•	Energy usage optimization by automating the switching of machines on/off based on demand.
•	Cloud-based dashboards for remote monitoring and control of machinery.

Persona and Context Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?” Generated Context:
•	The user interface should be intuitive and provide real-time data on machine performance, energy usage, and alerts.
•	The system should convey reliability and ease of use, with minimal training required for operators.
# OUTPUT 
### 1. Define Purpose and Goals: 
 Purpose: To create a report generation system that responds dynamically to user 
input, generating actionable insights based on diAerent scenarios (e.g., order 
reports, inventory analytics, reservation statistics). 
### Goals: 
o Enhance user experience by providing tailored responses based on user 
roles and interactions. 
o Improve data accessibility and decision-making through scenario-based 
reporting. 
o Support diverse restaurant management operations by oAering 
customizable reports.
### 2. Identify Key Features: 
 Dynamic Reporting System: Based on the user’s input, generate diAerent types 
of reports (e.g., sales, inventory, reservations). 
 Scenario-Based Prompts: Use diAerent prompting techniques depending on 
the situation (e.g., when there is an inventory shortage or a spike in reservations). 
 Role-Specific Customization: DiAerent personas (managers, servers, chefs) 
should receive reports that fit their role in the restaurant. 
 Real-Time Data Integration: Ensure that the system pulls live data for accurate, 
timely reporting.
### 3. Set Persona and Tone: 
 Persona: Define personas such as: 
o Restaurant Managers: Interested in operational eAiciency and high-level 
analytics. 
o WaitstaA: Need quick, easy-to-read reports on customer orders, 
reservations, and updates. 
o Chefs: Primarily need inventory data and updates on incoming orders. 
o Customers: Might access reports related to their reservations or order 
history (if the system includes customer-facing components). 
 Tone: The tone should be professional but approachable, clear, and helpful. For 
managers, the tone could be more analytical, while for waitstaA, it might be 
more concise and action-oriented.
### 4. Gather Essential Resources: 
 Technical Tools: Choose the technologies that will allow for the development of 
dynamic report generation (e.g., data analytics tools, real-time databases, 
reporting frameworks). 
 User Data: Collect detailed user behavior data to understand how diAerent 
personas interact with the system. 
 API Integrations: Ensure smooth communication with POS systems, reservation 
platforms, and inventory management tools for real-time data collection. 
### 5. Refine Outputs for Clarity and Consistency: 
 Clear, Structured Reports: Ensure reports are presented in a user-friendly 
format with relevant data highlighted. Use tables, charts, and graphs to aid 
understanding. 
 Consistent Messaging: Messages should be clear and consistent across the 
system. For example, error messages, success prompts, and guidance should 
follow the same format and tone.
### 6. Prepare for Common Scenarios: 
 Inventory Shortage: Create a prompt that notifies the staA about low stock, 
suggesting solutions like automatic reordering. 
 High Reservation Volume: Set up a prompt for when reservations exceed a 
certain threshold, guiding managers to consider adjusting staAing or oAering 
promotions. 
 Unusual Order Patterns: Generate a report highlighting outlier order patterns, 
prompting managers to investigate.
### 7. Implement Error Handling: 
 Missing Data: If a report can’t be generated due to missing data (e.g., inventory 
data), the system should notify the user with a helpful message, such as "Missing 
inventory data for today's report. Please update the system." 
 System Failures: In case of system issues, create error prompts with 
troubleshooting steps or contact support options. 
 Input Validation: Ensure that user input (like dates, quantities, or categories) is 
validated and errors are clearly communicated.
### 8. Collect Feedback and Improve: 
 User Feedback: Collect feedback from diAerent user types on report usefulness 
and clarity. For instance, do managers find the analytics easy to interpret? Are 
servers getting the information they need in a timely manner? 
 Iterative Updates: Use feedback to improve both the reports and the prompting 
techniques. Consider implementing A/B testing for diAerent prompt types to see 
which works best in each scenario. 
 Analytics on Report Usage: Track how often certain reports are accessed, 
which prompts are most used, and how user satisfaction changes over time. 
# Example of Scenario-Based Prompting Techniques: 
### Let’s consider a scenario where there’s a high-volume reservation during a holiday: 
 The system can prompt the restaurant manager with a suggestion like: “Holiday 
reservation volume has exceeded 100% capacity. Would you like to oAer a 
discount to encourage oA-peak dining?” 
 For the waitstaA, the prompt could be: “New reservations added for tonight’s 
high-volume hours. Check the updated seating plan.” 
 For the chef, it might generate a report: “Alert: Increased orders for vegetarian 
options tonight. Please prepare accordingly.”

Result: The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.




# Result: Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully.
